The poing of this program is to essentially extract every single archive file(a.zip,b.rar,...) and then "go into" the folder that extraction produces and check if a certain file or folder exists or not. it then dletes either the folder or the archive depending on which is true. Since i'm using this for Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3, i have it setup to look for the folder named "fomod" and the file extension ".bsa", if anyone downloads this you may change it to whatever you like.

The Requirements to Run this Program are:
            Pyunpack Version: >=0.1.2. (just run "pip install pyunpack" without the quotes if you can run pip on your device)
            Patool Version:  >= 1.12. (just run "pip install patool" without the quotes if you can run pip on your device)

And that is all... any and all issues are my fault so just bring up an issue if it crashes on your device or something.
